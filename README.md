**1. The Game rules**
```
As a user
In order to play by the game rules
I want 'rock' to win over 'scissors'
I want 'scissors' to win over 'paper'
I want 'paper' to win over 'rock'
```
**2. Player hotkeys**

```
As a user
In order to play a game of 'rock paper scissors' against another person
I want the application to allow for two local players playing against each other


As a local player
In order not to give away my choice of 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' by typing or using the mouse
I want to be able to make my choice by using a single key for each choice
```
**3. Automatically determine winner after timeout**
```
As a player
In order to keep the game exciting
I want there to be a short time limit within which the player has to pick their choice
```
